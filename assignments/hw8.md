Reading: 
Griffiths, Chapter 6, Sections 1-3

You may work together and get help from other students. Your solutions must be written in your own words, without looking at someone else's solutions while
you write them.

Don't forget the 8 points that we are looking for in your solutions (see the peer evaluation checklist for them).

1.  Griffiths, Problem 6.16. (Coaxial cable with dielectric, good practice with Ampere's law, and H)

2. (this is really a chapter 5 problem) When particular materials are cooled below a certain critical temperature, they become
superconductors. One property of a type I superconductor is that the magnetic field vanishes
in its interior. Suppose a solid Type I superconducting sphere is placed in a constant,
external magnetic field. Solve for the magnetic field everywhere outside the sphere.

3. A thin disk of iron of radius R and thickness $$t << R$$ is magnetized in the direction parallel to
the axis, $$M = M_0\hat{z}$$ . Calculate H and B on the axis both inside and outside the iron.

4. A spherical permanent magnet has a uniform polarization M . Choose M to be along the
z axis. Calculate B everywhere.
