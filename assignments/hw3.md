Reading: Griffiths, Chapter 2, sections 3-5.


You may work together and get help from other students. Your solutions must be written in your own words, without looking at someone else's solutions while
you write them.

Don't forget the 8 points that we are looking for in your solutions (see the peer evaluation checklist for them).

In order to make sure you get your context and meaning/make sense points,
next to your answers, please put a “c” with a circle around it for context,
and an “m” with a circle around it for meaning.


1. Griffiths, Chapter 2, Problem 2.21

2. Griffiths, Chapter 2, Problem 2.34, parts a) and b only; and Problem 2.35.

3. At an early stage in the development of the atomic theory, J. J. Thompson proposed an atom consisting of a positive charge Ze spread uniformly throughout a sphere of radius $$R$$ where Z is the number of electrons each with charge -e and e is the fundamental unit of charge ($$1.6 \times 10^{-19}$$ Coulombs).  The point-like electrons are embedded in the uniform positive charge like raisins in raisin pudding, hence the name “raisin pudding” model of the atom.
    a) Find the force acting on one electron as a function of its distance $$r$$ from the center of the sphere. Assume that the charge of the remaining electrons is smeared out uniformly throughout the sphere.
    b) What type of motion does the electron execute in the radial direction?
    c) What is the frequency of this motion for a typical atomic radius of 1 angstrom (0.1 nm)?
    d) What is the frequency of an electron that is in a circular orbit about the center?  Interesting, no?
    e) How does this frequency compare with that of the fundamental Lyman $$\alpha$$ transition in
hydrogen? The wavelength of a Lyman $$\alpha$$ photon is 121.6 nm.

4. Find the charge distribution (i.e., the charge density) that produces the Yukawa potential (a model for the nuclear force), i.e.,

 $$ V(r) = \frac{A}{r}e^{-r/a}$$

 Hint: In addition to a continuous charge density, you must place a point charge at the origin.

 Why? Be sure to give the value of this point charge, which you should be able to identify
from the form of the electric field. If not, try Gauss’s law. 

5.   What is the capacitance of the earth? (Most of the surface of the earth is covered by sea water, a fairly good conductor.)

6.   A spherical balloon is made of lightweight, aluminized Mylar. It is suggested that it could be kept spherical simply by connecting it to a high-voltage source. The balloon has a diameter of 0.1 meter, and the maximum breakdown electric field in air is
$$ 3 \times 10^6$$ volts/meter.

       a) What is the maximum voltage that can be applied to the balloon?

       b)  What gas pressure inside the balloon would produce the same effect? What fraction of atmospheric pressure is this? Will it work?

--------I'm pushing the next two problems to the next problem set when/if I teach this class next-----------------

7.   Griffiths, Chapter 2, Problem 2.43.

8.   Suppose the two cylinders in the previous problem are of length, $$L$$, and have nearly the same radii, i.e. $$\frac{(b – a)}{b} << 1$$. Further suppose that the inner cylinder is displaced along the axis so that its end is a distance, $$x$$, from the end of the outer cylinder. Assume that a charge $$Q$$ is placed on the outer cylinder and that a charge
$$–Q$$ is placed on the inner cylinder. How do you think the charge is distributed on the two conductors? Compute the force on the inner cylinder. Is it sucked in or pushed out of the outer cylinder?  From your solution you will see that the analysis breaks down when $$x = L$$ and $$x = 0$$.  Speculate as to why this occurs.
*Hint: Calculate the energy stored in the capacitor (or work done to bring
the pieces together) as a function of $$x$$ using the
results of problem #3.
Recall energy in a capactor is $$\frac{1}{2}QV$$ just like $$W = \frac{1}{2}\int \rho V$$.  Then use $$F = -\frac{dw}{dx}$$,
i.e. the negative of the derivative with
respect to $$x$$ of
the work is the force required to to increase $$x$$.  Also, there are a bunch of minus signs floating around.  I found it helpful to think about which direction I expected the force to be so
that I could check your answer.*
