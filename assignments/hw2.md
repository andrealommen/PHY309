Reading: Griffiths, Chapter 2, sections 1-2.


You may work together and get help from other students. Your solutions must be written in your own words, without looking at someone else's solutions while
you write them.

Don't forget the 8 points that we are looking for in your solutions (see the peer evaluation checklist for them).

In order to make sure you get your context and meaning/make sense points,
next to your answers, please put a “c” with a circle around it for context,
and an “m” with a circle around it for meaning.

1. An infinitely long wire, stretching along the $$z$$ axis, is uniformly charged to l
Coulombs/meter. Find the electric field intensity outside the wire by: 
    a) using Gauss’s Law;
    b) integrating Coulomb’s Law directly, and 
*Main point: First and foremost this one convinced me I should 
apply Gauss' Law when I can. Second, doing the problem multiple
ways was a pretty fun way to check my answer. * 

2. Griffiths, Chapter 2, Problem 2.6. <br>
*Main point: I practiced setting up integrals to use Coulomb's
law.  I also learned how to check the limits to make sure my
answer is consistent. (This will be very valuable throughout
this class.)*

3. Griffiths, Chapter 2, Problem 2.15. (Thick spherical shell)
