Reading: Griffiths, Chapter 2, sections 1-2.

1. An infinitely long wire, stretching along the $$z$$ axis, is uniformly charged to l
Coulombs/meter. Find the electric field intensity outside the wire by: 
    a) using Gauss’s Law;
    b) integrating Coulomb’s Law directly, and 
*Main point: First and foremost this one convinced me I should 
apply Gauss' Law when I can. Second, doing the problem multiple
ways was a pretty fun way to check my answer. * 

2. Griffiths, Chapter 2, Problem 2.6. <br>
*Main point: I practiced setting up integrals to use Coulomb's
law.  I also learned how to check the limits to make sure my
answer is consistent. (This will be very valuable throughout
this class.)*

3. Griffiths, Chapter 2, Problem 2.15. (Thick spherical shell)
