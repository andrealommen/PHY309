Reading: 
Griffiths, Chapter 5 and 6

Unless I say otherwise, you may work together and get help from other students. Your solutions must be written in your own words, without looking at someone else's solutions while
you write them.

Don't forget to finish each problem by writing the main point.

______________________________________________________________________________
I'm choosing a subset (5) of these problems.  In case you're itching to get started
I'm posting them now.  If you start them before I choose which 5 I'm assigning, tell
me which ones you want to do.
