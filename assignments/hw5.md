Reading: 
Griffiths, Chapter 5 and 6

Unless I say otherwise, you may work together and get help from other students. Your solutions must be written in your own words, without looking at someone else's solutions while
you write them.

Don't forget to finish each problem by writing the main point.

1.	Griffiths, Problem 5.16. (Coaxial solenoids, find field everywhere. You could do this problem in 106.  I just want you to practice doing it.)
2.	Griffiths, Problem 5.24. (Find the bound current density from a particular vector potential.  Really just math practice.)
3.	Griffiths, Problem 5.41. (The Hall effect - 3 parts but none is long, really important concept)
4.	Griffiths, Problem 5.58. (Gyromagnetic ratio, good practice with magnetic moment, and an important concept)
5.	Griffiths, Problem 6.16. (Coaxial cable with dielectric, good practice with Ampere's law, and H)
