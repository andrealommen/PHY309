Reading: 
* Griffiths, Chapter 10

Unless I say otherwise, you may work together and get help from other students. Your solutions must be written in your own words, without looking at someone else's solutions while
you write them.

Don't forget to finish each problem by writing the main point.

______________________________________________________________________________
1. Griffiths 10.12 Calculate the retarded potential of a current loop
with increasing current.
You're only calculating the potential at the center,
so $$\mathscr{r}$$ can be replaced by the distance from the ring
to the center.

2. Griffiths 10.20 A relatively straightforward application of equation
10.72 - the fields derived from the Leinard-Weichert potentials. 

3. Griffiths 10.24 Glue charge onto a plastic ring and spin it.
As in number 1, you're only calculating the potential at the center,
so $$\mathscr{r}$$ can be replaced by the distance from the ring
to the center.

4. Griffiths 10.30 A charged rod with constant velocity.  You're asked
to verify that
your answer is consistent with Leinard-Weichert potential.
