Reading: 
Griffiths, Chapter 7

You may work together and get help from other students. Your solutions must be written in your own words, without looking at someone else's solutions while
you write them.

Don't forget the 9 points that we are looking for in your solutions (see Moodle).

In order to make sure you get your context and meaning/make sense points,
next to your answers, please put a “c” with a circle around it for context,
and an “m” with a circle around it for meaning.

______________________________________________________________________________

1.	Griffiths, Problem 7.3
2.	Griffiths, Problem 7.11.
3.	Griffiths, Problem 7.23.
4.	Griffiths, Problem 7.50.

	We will not start this problem in class, but it is still on your homework. Spend a half hour by yourself working on setting up the problem before you speak with any of your classmates or TAs or Andrea.

5.	Griffiths, Problem 7.62. This type of transmission line is referred to by electrical engineers as a “strip line.”

Extra problem for fun:	Suppose a solenoid has a uniform density of turns except near the ends where extra turns are added to obtain a higher magnetic field than that near the center. Show qualitatively that, if its axial velocity is not too large, a charged particle that spirals along the axis inside the solenoid will be reflected back when it reaches either end. The regions of higher magnetic field are called “magnetic mirrors,” and the entire device is called a “magnetic bottle” for obvious reasons.  The Van Allen radiation belts around the Earth consists of electrons and protons from the Sun that have been captured by the Earth’s magnetic field via this effect.


Some hints if you want them:

Hints for HW9

7.3
You usually find capacitance by assuming there’s a charge Q on each conductor.  You can do that here, too.  Ohm’s law will tell you how the current density is related to the electric field.  And Gauss’s law will tell you how the electric field is related to the charge.  I think you can take it from there.

7.11
You do have to look up the density and conductivity of aluminum. If you express things in terms of the cross-sectional area of the loop (the cross-section lying in a plane perpendicular to the direction its falling) then the cross-sectional area cancels out.

7.23
First compute the mutual inductance M.  To do this, put I in the outer loop and compute the flux in the inner loop.  Check out 7.22 and then notice (7.24) that the mutual inductance is the same whether you’re asking about the flux induced in the big loop by the current in the small loop or the the other way around.  I believe Griffiths even calls that “cute.”

7.62
I’d use the parallel plate formula for capacitance. (You could also derive it from Gauss’s law and the definition of capacitance.). Then I’d combine 7.35 and 7.30 to get the inductance.
