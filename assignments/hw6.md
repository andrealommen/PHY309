Reading: 
Griffiths, Chapter 7

Unless I say otherwise, you may work together and get help from other students. Your solutions must be written in your own words, without looking at someone else's solutions while
you write them.

Don't forget to finish each problem by writing the main point.

______________________________________________________________________________

1.	Griffiths, Problem 7.3
2.	Griffiths, Problem 7.11.
3.	Griffiths, Problem 7.23.
4.	Griffiths, Problem 7.50.

Work the following problems by yourself with no help from other students.

5.	Griffiths, Problem 7.62. This type of transmission line is referred to by electrical engineers as a “strip line.”

Extra Credit:	Suppose a solenoid has a uniform density of turns except near the ends where extra turns are added to obtain a higher magnetic field than that near the center. Show qualitatively that, if its axial velocity is not too large, a charged particle that spirals along the axis inside the solenoid will be reflected back when it reaches either end. The regions of higher magnetic field are called “magnetic mirrors,” and the entire device is called a “magnetic bottle” for obvious reasons.  The Van Allen radiation belts around the Earth consists of electrons and protons from the Sun that have been captured by the Earth’s magnetic field via this effect.
