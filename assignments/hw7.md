Reading: 
Griffiths, Chapter 5

You may work together and get help from other students. Your solutions must be written in your own words, without looking at someone else's solutions while
you write them.

Don't forget the 8 points that we are looking for in your solutions (see the peer evaluation checklist for them).

In order to make sure you get your context and meaning/make sense points, 
next to your answers, please put a “c”with circle around it for context, 
and an “m” with a circle around it for meaning.

1.	Griffiths, Problem 5.16. (Coaxial solenoids, find field everywhere. You could do this problem in 106.  I just want you to practice doing it.)
2.	Griffiths, Problem 5.24. (Find the bound current density from a particular vector potential.  Really just math practice.)
3.	Griffiths, Problem 5.41. (The Hall effect - 3 parts but none is long, really important concept)
4.	Griffiths, Problem 5.58. (Gyromagnetic ratio, good practice with magnetic moment, and an important concept)
