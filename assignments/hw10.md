Reading: 
* Griffiths, Chapter 11

Unless I say otherwise, you may work together and get help from other students. Your solutions must be written in your own words, without looking at someone else's solutions while
you write them.

Don't forget to finish each problem by writing the main point.

______________________________________________________________________________
1. Griffiths Problem 11.1 Check that the deferred potential of an oscillating dipole satisfy the Lorenz gauge condition. Do not use approximation 3. 
2. Griffiths Problem 11.12 Radiation from an electron falling under the
influence of gravity.  Hint: You can write down the acceleration for a falling mass pretty easily!  Then use Equation 11.60 to get the power.
3. Griffiths Problem 11.22 Radiation from a charge on a spring. Hint: To start use 11.21 to get the time-averaged pointing vector.
4. Griffiths Problem 11.25 The oscillating magnetic dipole of the earth becomes a dipole radiator.  Hint: Start with 11.40.  The trickiest part is probably figuring out what 
fraction of the earth's magnetic field is actually an oscillating magnetic dipole.  Part of the magnetic field is unchanging, and part is oscillating.
