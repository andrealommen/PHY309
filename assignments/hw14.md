Reading: 
* Griffiths, Chapter 12.1 and 12.3
I'm hoping that 12.3 makes sense without 12.2, but you'll have to let me know.
You might end up having to skim through 12.2 for some things you need.

You may work together and get help from other students. Your solutions must be written in your own words, without looking at someone else's solutions while
you write them.

Don't forget the 8 points that we are looking for in your solutions (see the peer evaluation checklist for them).

In order to make sure you get your context and meaning/make sense points,
next to your answers, please put a “c” with a circle around it for context,
and an “m” with a circle around it for meaning.
