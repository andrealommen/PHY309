Reading: Griffiths Chapter 3, sections 1 and 2

You may only use Mathematica on the last one.  I don't actually think you need it on any of the problems, so don't take that as a sign that I think the last one is harder than the others.


1.   A point charge, $$Q$$, is placed equidistant between two parallel, grounded, conducting plates separated by a distance, $$D$$. Assume the sizes of the plates are much larger than their separation.

       a) What are the strengths and positions of the image charges which will give the potential everywhere between the plates? (There are many, many of them! Also notice that I did **not** say to find the potential everywhere.)

       b) Find an expression for the surface charge density on either plate at the point adjacent to the charge.  (The sum you just found is called Catalan’s Constant.) *Hint: Somewhat unexpectedly (at least to me) this problem is easier to do in terms of electric field instead of 
potential.  Remember to get the surface charge density on a conductor you just multiply the
field by $$\epsilon_0$$, so you really only need the electric field at the point in question*. 

2.   Example 3.2 on page 128 of Griffiths locates the appropriate image charge for the case of a point charge outside a grounded conducting sphere. What are the magnitudes and positions of the image charges (there are two of them) for the case of a point charge outside an isolated, neutral, conducting sphere?  What is the potential of the sphere?

3.   Two “infinite”, parallel, conducting plates separated by a distance, $$s$$, are at potentials $$0$$ and $$V_0$$.

      There is a volume charge density, $$\rho = \rho_0\frac{x}{s}$$, between the two plates where $$x$$ is the distance from the plate at zero potential.

       a) Use Poisson’s equation to find the potential $$V$$ in the region between the plates.

       b) What are the surface charge densities on the plates?

       c) Show that the total charge per unit area (on both plates plus the charge between them) vanishes as it must to ensure that $$E = 0$$ inside the conductors.
