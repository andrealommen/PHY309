Haverford College is committed to providing equal access to students with a disability. As an instructor, I want to see all of you learn, thrive and contribute to your fullest. To this purpose, I try to incorporate Universal Design principles in our class’s structure;  feel free to discuss with me any ways we could make the entire course more broadly accessible.  If you have (or think you have) a learning difference or disability – including mental health, medical, or physical impairment, please contact the Office of Access and Disability Services (ADS) at hc-ads@haverford.edu.  The Coordinator will confidentially discuss the process to establish reasonable accommodations.

Students who have already been approved to receive academic accommodations and want to use their accommodations in this course should share their verification letter with me (Andrea Lommen) and also make arrangements to meet with me as soon as possible to discuss their the specific accommodations.  Please note that accommodations are not retroactive and require advance notice to implement.

It is a state law in Pennsylvania that individuals must be given advance notice if they are to be recorded.  Therefore, any student who has a disability-related need to audio record this class must first be approved for this accommodation from the Coordinator of Access and Disability Services and then must speak with me.  Other class members will need to be aware that this class may be recorded.
