* I think realistically we'll be able to grade about three of the problems from the homework in class.  Maybe as the semester goes on we'll get better at it.  The rest of them will be graded by a Bryn Mawr grad student. I will be checking over everything, both what you do and what the grader does, before I decide on an actual grade.
* Saturday, February 8 from 9:30-12:30 there's a workshop with Melodie Kao called: Practical Skills for Emerging Scholars: Navigating Personal Boundaries to Set Yourself and Your Community up for Success <br> 
Abstract: Scientific research demands us to be resilient, creative, effective communicators, and skilled at establishing boundaries with our colleagues and with ourselves. The most important of these skills is boundary setting, which is the art of clearly articulating what is acceptable in interpersonal interactions, learning when to say yes and when to say no, and upholding your personal values in everyday moments. Mastering boundaries helps scientists create professional environments that foster resiliency, creativity, and effective communication. In the first part of this hands-on workshop, you will learn why boundaries are so important, practice recognizing when you need to set them, and practice setting them.  In the second part of the workshop, you will apply these skills to the art of collaboratively navigating conflict and maintaining healthy interpersonal and working relationships. You will develop your own personalized toolkit using techniques that draw from both peer-reviewed psychology and pedagogy research as well as tried-and-true methods.
* Watch for the application and reimbursement process.
