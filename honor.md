The important guiding principle of academic integrity is that you must never represent the work of others as your own.  The following guidelines should govern your behavior in the course; please request clarification from me, other instructors or Honor Council if you find yourself in any ambiguous situations.  Also, consult the Honor Council resources website at:  http://honorcouncil.haverford.edu/resources/.

Exams must be entirely your own work.  Detailed instructions will be given on the exams themselves and discussed in advance.  No collaboration of any sort is allowed once you start an exam.  You must use only the resources indicated on the exam’s first page.  You must complete all exam work (including copying solutions over neatly) within the allowed time (a single contiguous block).

Homework & any other non-exam assignments:  You may seek assistance from the instructor or from your fellow students in doing the weekly assigned exercises and preparing for class discussions and labs.
For your own good, you should be sure to first attempt and make a good effort at completing problems BEFORE working on them in a group setting.  Avoid situations in which you are either contributing either too much or too little to such collaborations.  Please consult me if you need guidance on negotiating this issue.  

Citing sources:  If you need to reference work from any written source in completing an assignment, you must cite it appropriately, and you must not copy from it.
Copying someone else’s work (either another student in the course, solutions posted online or material from ANY source) is a clear Honor Code violation and will result in your being referred to Honor Council.  To avoid this situation, never copy over for credit work done in a collaborative setting.  Put aside or cover up any notes you have written down from group collaborations and write up your solutions separately, using what you learned from them.  It is good practice to use some clear code to label cooperative work (such as colored paper or a big C label in the top right corner.  
Never copy directly from a group solution, either on paper or on a blackboard. Just writing down the names of students with whom you have worked on your homework does not make such copying acceptable behavior.
