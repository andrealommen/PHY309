Textbook:  Introduction to Electrodynamics by David J. Griffiths, 4th edition

Thank you to Steve Boughn for much of this content.

# References  
Several other electrodynamics texts will be placed on reserve in the White Science Library. These will include Electromagnetic Fields and Waves by Lorrain and Corson, which is comparable in level to your text, and Classical Electrodynamics by J. D. Jackson, which has been the standard introductory graduate text for years. Also on reserve is Electricity and Magnetism:  Berkeley Series Volume 2 by Purcell for those who feel a bit rusty or would benefit from a somewhat lower-level treatment.

# Course Description

The format of each class will be a very short (25 min) review lecture highlighting the important points of your reading. The rest of the time will be devoted to collaborative problem solving. Since not all the relevant material will be covered in the lectures, it is essential that the assigned reading be completed before coming to class each Tuesday. The textbook by Griffiths gives an excellent intermediate-level treatment of electrodynamics. It is well written in an informal style that lends itself well to self study. The classes will be of considerably diminished value to those who come unprepared.  

While the primary purpose of this course is a formal, mathematical introduction to electrodynamics including Maxwell's Equations and radiation, applications to other areas of physics and astrophysics will be highlighted in the assignments and workshops.
