* Open book, open notes, but I think you'll be better off if you pretend I said you get a page of notes and nothing else, and then use those notes. This list
of [vector identities](MTE02.pdf) might be useful.
* 4 problems on the exam.
* Created as a 2-hour exam.
* You'll have 3 hours to do it.  Any contiguous three hours of your 
own choosing.

I will pick from these types of problems:
* Vector identity (e.g. curl theorem, divergence theorem, etc.)
* Boundary value in one dimension (or if it's two dimensions one of the dimensions will be really easy.)
* Dielectric problem. One obvious one is using the D version of Gauss's Law and then find E, and then find potential.
* Method of Images (unlikely to make you write out solution, but you'd have to be able to come up with the Image charges and explain what criteria you used to find them, and how you would use them to find the field)
* The field of a dipole.
