The exam will be available on this page at noon on Tuesday, March 3rd, and will be due at 4pm on
Friday, March 6th.

Instructions: 
You may choose 3 contiguous hours to work on this exam.  You may use your notes, the book, and anything found at andrealommen.github.io/PHY309.  If you wish to take a 15-minute break during the exam (which I recommend) you may then take 3 hours and 15 minutes to work on the exam.

I have some extra office hours listed on the "help" tab of the web page.

You may use Mathematica if you wish.

Please write your answers on paper, staple them with the problems in order 1 to 4, put the last 4 
digits of your SID and place the completed exam
in the lock box by my office L108 in the KINSC..

There are 4 problems.
