Some equations with minus signs that I want to remember:

$$
V_b - V_a = - \int_a^b \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l}
$$

where $$d\vec{l}$$ points along the path you're taking from $$a$$ to $$b$$.

At the surface of a conductor:

$$
\vec{E} =  \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0} \hat{n}
$$

Notice the surface charge density $$\sigma$$ is positive if the E-field points 
out of the surface.  That
makes sense, right?  because E-field lines should start on positive charges.

and

$$
\sigma = -\epsilon_0 \frac{dV}{d\hat{n}}
$$

where $$\vec{n}$$ is the vector perpendicular to the surface. Note that you have
to get that vector in the correct direction in order to get the correct
sign of the charge.

$$
\nalba^2 =  -\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}
$$
