## Problems we'll peer-grade on the homework
6 and then part of 4/5

## Running summary of the last three weeks of class

## Answers to some questions that came up in class:

How do you tell which term in the multipole expansion is dominant?  Isn't
the $$1/r$$ term always dominant?

Not if the total charge is zero!  Here's a picture of the charge distribution as they are orthoganol...

Or maybe the answer to that depends on r?  (Yes and no, some??? of
the moments depend on r??)

How does the derivation of the dipole connect to multipole expansion?
