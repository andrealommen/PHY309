**First uniqueness theorem:** 

The solution to Laplace's equation in some volume $$\mathscr{V}$$ is uniquely determined if the $$V$$ (the potential) is specified on the boundary surface $$S$$. 

**Second uniqueness theorem:** 

In a volume $$\mathscr{V}$$ surrounded by
conductors and containing a specified charge density $$\rho$$, the electric
field is uniquely determined if the *total charge* on each conductor is given.
