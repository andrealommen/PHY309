You've actually learned all the ways to deal with static distributions of charges.  Now we have to deal with the fields in matter.

Polarization

This is the chapter where we go from Electric fields to Displacement Field,
which is the more general field.

I mentioned that dipoles would figure prominently in this chapter. It happens right away. And my example of an atom with a dipole moment comes up immediately.
This chapter is about electric fields in matter (that's what the chapter is
called.) So immediately if you put an atom in an electric field, the positive
part of the atom is forced in the direction of the electric field, 
and the negative part of the atom is forced in the opposite direction. 
Different atoms are able to **polarize** by different amounts depending
upon their electronic configuration. Their *atomic polarizability* is designated
by $$\alpha$$ and is the constant of proportionality between the applied
electric field $$\vec{E}$$ and the dipole moment $$\vec{p}$$.

$$
\vec{p} = \alpha \vec{E}
$$

Your book (top of page 168) lists some $$\alpha$$'s.  They range from
almost 1 for Hydrogen to almost 60 for Cesium.

Because of the opposite forces on the positive and negative side of
the atom, or dipole, there's a torque on the dipole:

$$
\vec{N} = \vec{p} \times \vec{E}
$$

The above is the torque on a dipole $$\vec{p}$$ in a uniform field $$\vec{E}$$.
Griffiths derives that handily, in case you'd like to see that.
The effect of the torque is to align the dipole with the electric field
in which case we say the material is *polarized*. We'll get to that in a 
second.

There's also a force on the dipole:
$$
\vec{F} = (\vec{p} \cdot \nabla) \vec{E}.
$$

And the energy of a dipole in an electric field....

What do you think?  By the $$\vec{N}$$ above it should have a lot of energy
if the dipole and electric field are anti aligned, and none if they're
aligned.

$$
U = - \vec{p} \cdot \vec{E}
$$

Does that work?  If they're aligned the dot product is a maximum and $$U$$
is a minimum.  If they're anti-aligned the dot product is a minimum and
$$U$$ is  maximum.  Yes!

## Polarization
A material is said to be polarized if its atoms are roughly lined up. 
Polarization $$\vec{P}$$ is defined as

$$
\vec{P} = {\rm dipole~moment~per~unit~volume}
$$

## The field of a polarized object
(First we deal with the field from this object by itself, then in the next
section we'll add the applied field to the induced field and get the total
field.)
