#### Short answer.  yes.

#### Funner answer follows. (Thanks to Nathan Merrill for this question.)

On your last homework you found that the thickness of the quarter wave plate was

$$
t = \frac{\pi c}{2 \omega (n_x - n_y)}
$$

Let's turn that around and get the difference between $$n_x$$ and $$n_y$$ for a particular
thickness $$t$$.  In other words, if you want to make a quarter-wave plate out of a
material of thickness $$t$$ then the difference between $$n_x$$ and $$n_y$$ must be

$$
n_x - n_y = \frac{\pi c}{2 \omega t}
$$

I think this equation would make more sense in terms of the wavelength $$\lambda$$:

$$
\omega = \frac{2\pi c}{\lambda}
$$

then

$$
n_x - n_y = \frac{\pi c}{2 \left(\frac{2\pi c}{\lambda}\right) t}
$$

$$
n_x - n_y = \frac{\lambda}{4 t}
$$

Oh, look at that!!  It's a **quarter** wave plate and the index of refraction has to
be different by the ratio between a quarter wavelength and the thickness of the material.

For typical numbers what is that difference $$n_x - n_y$$?  I'm not sure I've ever seen a quarter-wave plate, but let's go for a quarter of a cm.  And the middle of the optical band has a wavelength of 600 nm.  So then

$$
n_x - n_y = \frac{600 nm}{4 \times .25 cm} = 6 \times 10^{-6}
$$

That's pretty small!!  Okay, but does it justify our idea that the transmission 
coefficients are identical?  

The transmission coefficient for normal incidence between two materials $$n_1$$ and
$$n_2$$ is:

$$
T = \frac{4n_1 n_2}{(n_1 + n_2)^2}
$$

Let's assume we're going from air $$n_1=1$$ to either $$n_x$$ or $$n_y$$. Let's assume
$$n_x = n$$ and $$n_y = n + \delta$$.

The ratio of the two transmission coefficients (to $$n_x$$ or to $$n_y$$) is then

$$
\frac{T_y}{T_x} = 
\frac{
 \frac{4n(n+\delta)}{(1 + n + \delta)^2}
}{
 \frac{4n(n)}{(1 + n)^2}
}
$$

$$
\frac{T_y}{T_x} = \left(\frac{n+\delta}{n}\right)\left(\frac{1 + n}{1 + n + \delta}\right) 
$$


$$
\frac{T_y}{T_x} = \left(1+\frac{\delta}{n}\right)\left(\frac{1}{1 + \frac{\delta}{1 + n}}\right) 
$$

Use a Taylor series on the second term.

$$
\frac{T_y}{T_x} = \left(1+\frac{\delta}{n}\right)\left({1 - \frac{\delta}{1 + n}}\right) 
$$

$$
\frac{T_y}{T_x} = 1+\frac{\delta}{n} - \frac{\delta}{1 + n} + h.o.t.
$$

$$
\frac{T_y}{T_x} = 1+\frac{\delta}{n^2+1}  + h.o.t.
$$

By our previous calculation $$\delta$$ is going to have a value like $$10^{-5}$$
and the denominator really isn't that much different than unity.  So the difference
in transmission coefficients is going to be a factor of $$\approx 1.00001$$.
The light goes through two interfaces with the same transmission coefficient so
the number we're interested is $$T^2$$, but
1.00001 squared is still something like 1 part in $$10^5$$.
So the difference in the intensity of light between the two polarizations will
be something like one part in 
$$10^5$$.
