The exam will be available on this page at noon on Monday, April 6, and will be due at 4pm (local time zone) on
Wednesday, April 8th.

Instructions: 
You may choose 3 contiguous hours to work on this exam.  You may use your notes, the book, and anything found at andrealommen.github.io/PHY309.  If you wish to take a 15-minute break during the exam (which I recommend) you may then take 3 hours and 15 minutes to work on the exam.

You may use Mathematica if you wish but you must follow the rules for making it readable.

Please scan your answers and submit them to the dropbox folder I will make available.  Do NOT count your time scanning and submitting as part of the 3 hours.

There are 4 problems.  

Please email me when you are starting the exam.

(You may either print this out or write this statement on your exam and sign
it.)

I accept full responsibility under the Haverford College Honor System for my conduct on the examination.
