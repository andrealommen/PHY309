* The Exam will be available [here](secondexam) from 6pm on Saturday April 4.
* The Exam is due in the drop box by midnight on Saturday March 11. (The time you spend
scanning and dropbox-ing does NOT count toward your 3 hours.)
* Open book, open notes, but I think you'll be better off if you pretend I said you get a page of notes and nothing else, and then use those notes. This list
of [vector identities](MTE02.pdf) might be useful.
* 4 problems on the exam.
* Created as a 2-hour exam.
* You'll have 3 hours to do it.  Any contiguous three hours of your 
own choosing.
* You may use Mathematica but I don't think you'll need it.
* You may take a 15-minute break during the exam and add back in the 15 minutes to the end of your 3-hour stint.
* You may use the book, your class notes, and anything on my web page andrealommen.github.io/PHY309 but nothing else from the web.
