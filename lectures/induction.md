### Last time:

### The Auxiliary Field

We said that the total current density was the sum of the free and bound current, where
the so-called "bound" current is created by the alignment of atoms in the material. 

$$
\vec{J} = \vec{J}_b + \vec{J}_f
$$

$$\vec{H}$$ the auxiliary field, is the field (divided by $$\mu_0$$) that would be
there if only the free current existed.  The piece due to the magnetism is subtracted off.

$$
\vec{H} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \vec{B} - \vec{M}
$$

and Ampere's law now reads:

$$
\nabla \times \vec{H} = \vec{J}_f
$$

or in integral form:

$$
\oint \vec{H}\cdot d\vec{l} = I_{free}
$$
