* The Exam will be available [here](firstexam) from noon on Tuesday March 2.
* The Exam is due in the lock box outside my office by 4pm on Friday March 6.
* Open book, open notes, but I think you'll be better off if you pretend I said you get a page of notes and nothing else, and then use those notes. This list
of [vector identities](MTE02.pdf) might be useful.
* 4 problems on the exam.
* Created as a 2-hour exam.
* You'll have 3 hours to do it.  Any contiguous three hours of your 
own choosing.
* You may use Mathematica but I don't think you'll need it.
* You may take a 15-minute break during the exam and add back in the 15 minutes to the end of your 3-hour stint.
* You may use the book, your class notes, and anything on my web page andrealommen.github.io/PHY309 but nothing else from the web.

I will pick from these types of problems:
* Vector identity (e.g. curl theorem, divergence theorem, etc.)
* Boundary value in one dimension (or if it's two dimensions one of the dimensions will be really easy.) It's particularly important that you understand the boundary conditions in any given problem, and understand why matching your solution to the boundary conditions gets you the
potential everywhere.
* Dielectric problem. One obvious one is using the D version of Gauss's Law and then find E, and then find potential.
* Method of Images (unlikely to make you write out solution, but you'd have to be able to come up with the Image charges and explain what criteria you used to find them, and how you would use them to find the field). It's important to understand why the method of images is even valid, and where it's valid.
* The field of a dipole.
* Poisson's Equation/Laplace's Equation
* Calculating the Energy of a charge distribution
* Calculating the potential directly using Coulomb's law
*
