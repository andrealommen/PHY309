Here's my crash course of chapter 2. I claim you could do the whole problem set after you read this. (You should start the problem set, by the way. It's long and it's due a week from Wednesday. Do one problem a day starting today.)

**V $$\rightarrow$$ E**

$$
\vec{E} = -\nabla V
$$

**E $$\rightarrow$$ F**

$$
\vec{F} = q\vec{E}
$$

**F $$\rightarrow$$ W**

$$
W = \int \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{l}
$$

**V $$\rightarrow$$ W**

$$
W = q V 
$$

or if you have a collection of charges then...

$$
W = \frac{1}{2}\int \rho V d\tau
$$

(That's same formula as the one above it. The $$\frac{1}{2}$$ is
annoying but it's just because of double-counting.)

**E $$\rightarrow$$ W**

This is also just the formula above translated into $$\vec{E}$$ using
Gauss' Law.

$$
W = \frac{\epsilon_0}{2} \int E^2 d\tau
$$

**Gauss's law, $$\rho$$ $$\rightarrow$$ E**

$$
\oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{a} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} Q_{\rm encl}
$$

**E $$\rightarrow \rho$$** (Gauss' law backwards)

$$
\rho = \epsilon_0 \nabla \cdot \vec{E}
$$
