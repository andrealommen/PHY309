As you come into class today: Be prepared to answer this question:

An uncharged spherical conductor centered at the origin has a  cavity of some weird shape carved out of it (Fig. 2.46). Somewhere within the  cavity is a charge q. Question: What is the field outside the sphere? 
(Griffiths example 2.10)
