(There will be a pdf available for you to print out if you like.)

This exam is due at noon on Friday May 15.

Instructions: 
You may choose 3 contiguous hours to work on this exam.  You may use your notes, the book, and anything found at andrealommen.github.io/PHY309.  If you wish to take a 15-minute break during the exam (which I recommend) you may then take 3 hours and 15 minutes to work on the exam.

You may use Mathematica if you wish but you must follow the rules for making it readable.

If you can't complete a problem, please make as much progress as you can, and in 
all cases provide all the
work you were able to do.  This will ensure that I get as much information about
your thought process as possible. You know me - I love giving credit for great thinking. 

Please scan your answers and submit them to the dropbox folder I will make available.  Do NOT count your time scanning and submitting as part of the 3 hours.

There are 4 problems.  

Please email me when you are starting the exam.

(You may either print this out or write this statement on your exam and sign
it.)

I accept full responsibility under the Haverford College Honor System for my conduct on the examination.
