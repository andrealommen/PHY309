### The scheme for the week 
* Then we need to go back to potentials, particularly vector potentials, so that we can understand retarded potentials, so that we can understand how radiation occurs. (We've talked about electromagnetic waves, but you'll notice we haven't talked about how we generate them at all. We
ve just assumed they're there and tried to understand their properties. In this very last section of the course, we need to generate them.

### Last time we practiced using

$$
V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\int\frac{\rho(\vec{r}^\prime, t_r)}{\mathscr{r}}d\tau^\prime
$$

$$
\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\int\frac{\vec{J}(\vec{r}^\prime, t_r)}{\mathscr{r}}d\tau^\prime
$$

What does the retarded time correspond to?  

$$
t_r = t - \frac{\mathscr{r}}{c}
$$

What we want to get to today is the equations for E and B on page 459-460
and in particular the discussion on page 460 about the Coulomb field and
the radiation field.  We won't have time to derive the L-W potentials,
and we won't have time to get the generalized version of E and B from
them, so we'll have to make some keen choices to accomplish this goal.
