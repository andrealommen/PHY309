In academics we strive to have everyone learn and thrive to the fullest extent as part of a shared intellectual community. Let’s work together at making all types of diversity a strength and resources.  Come prepared to engage in vigorous discussion and to respect your classmates, while honoring necessary structures for ensuring everyone gets a voice and that we stay on course. We’re all learning together how to make this work, so let me know if I (we) can do better, in or out of class, either in person or anonymously.
