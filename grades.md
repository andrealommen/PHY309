Here's how I calculate the grades:

Reading Notes 20%

First Draft Solutions 20%

Collaborative Peer Evaluation 15%

Pretty Copy Solutions 15%

Quizzes 20%

Participation 10%

**Participation:**

There is a small participation component for this class. In general it will not affect your
grade unless you are consistently late or absent without good reason and especially if you
do not give timely feedback to your collaborator(s). The reason for this policy is that this
course is designed to build strong collaborations and that requires trust and reliability.
