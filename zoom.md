[Here's the link to the folder where I store the zoom videos.](https://haverford.box.com/s/j0e88qh9jmgf98ew2xjpn338d49hwz59)

For each day of class there will be up to 4 files:

* .mp4 -> The video - this is probably what you want to watch.
* .m4a -> A sound file of the class (I think)
* .txt -> Everything that got typed in the chat window
* .vtt -> A transcription of everything that got said!!!!!  I had no idea Zoom did this.    It labels it by minute so it would help you go to certain parts of the recording if you wanted to.
