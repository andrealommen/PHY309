Why do I have to do git push -u origin master?
Can I do a shortcut push when I'm just tweaking? - oh maybe that's what jaycu does...

x 1. Get Jekyll
x 2. Create separate documents for the separate pages (I think you've got two grids - one in excel and one in word - that's confusing)
	And you need a way to update the grid - so however you get from excel to the web page, you should document
	it so that you can do it again (unless you think updating the markdown directly is okay)
/ 3. Make everything link to each other
	So you'll have course description, grid, and then each assignment will be linked from the grid - probably just to box.  So I could do that now - put each assignment in box.  So then you just need course description linked to grid and main and grid to course description and main
4. Make a document directory that holds all the assignments (box is fine - that makes it easy to change)
This is where I stopped. A pdf works fine, but maybe box would be easier for changing them. I wouldn't be saving them as PDFs. So I think try the box link idea - might not be as nice because you might not be able to go back with your browser.
4. Serve it all to git and try git gui
5. Link all of this on your web page.


then make the one for 104 (maybe that's tomorrow)
