Textbook:  Introduction to Electrodynamics by David J. Griffiths

You: Are awesome

# References  
Several other electrodynamics texts will be placed on reserve in the White Science Library. These will include Electromagnetic Fields and Waves by Lorrain and Corson, which is comparable in level to your text, and Classical Electrodynamics by J. D. Jackson, which has been the standard introductory graduate text for years. Also on reserve is Electricity and Magnetism:  Berkeley Series Volume 2 by Purcell for those who feel a bit rusty or would benefit from a somewhat lower-level treatment.

# Course Description

The format of this class will be a combination of lectures and workshops. Since not all the relevant material will be covered in the lectures, it is essential that the assigned reading be completed before coming to class. The textbook by Griffiths gives an excellent intermediate-level treatment of electrodynamics. It is well written in an informal style that lends itself well to self study. The classes will be of considerably diminished value to those who come unprepared.  Students are encouraged to attend one or more of the scheduled office hours. These often  become workshops during which students work problems at the board.  The tentative syllabus listed below is ambitious. With the exception of Special Relativity (Chapter 12), most of the material in the textbook will be covered during the semester. Even though we will skip several sections of the text, I urge you to read the entire book. 

While the primary purpose of this course is a formal, mathematical introduction to electrodynamics including Maxwell's Equations and radiation, applications to other areas of physics and astrophysics will be highlighted in the assignments and workshops.

# Homework and Exams

Weekly homework will be assigned. Collaboration on homework problems is allowed (even encouraged) except when explicitly excluded.  Assignments up to one week late will be accepted but will be penalized 1 point per day (weekends excluded).  No credit will be given for assignments more than one week late.  There will be two midterm exams and a 3 hour final exam. Two thirds of the final course grade will be determined from exam scores and one third from performance on homework assignments.
